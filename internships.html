									<h3 class="major">Summer 2018: Microsoft -- Completed Internship</h3>
									<p>For the duration of summer 2018 I was an explore intern at Microsoft. As an explore intern we are able to try the software engineer role as well as the program management role. The program is built for development so we are paired with two other interns for the project. I worked under Azure, Microsoft's cloud sector within Azure PIE (Product Infrastructure Engineering).</p>

									<p>Our project for the summer was to create an in-app expierence for Microsoft's Incident Management platform. The platform is currently only internal, but in preperation of possibly making it a public we were assigned to make an in- app expierence to improve usability. In-app expierence was defined by our team as an expierence in which a user who is not familiar with the platform at all would be able to follow guided interactive tours developed by our team to self teach themselves to become proficient in the program. As the user became more proficient the tours available would increase to more advanced topics. We completed this goal within our time restraint setting up a template the team could easily duplicate and change to easily create in-app tours as well as creating the basic tours for new users.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Summer 2019: Microsoft -- Upcoming Internship</h3>
									<p>After my expierence as a explore intern I decided I wanted to try out the program management role. I chose this route because I feel like my strengths lie in being the connection between code development and talking with a team. With my technical background I will be able to work side by side with developers as well as communicate with the business side of the project to create a efficient and thoughtful project. After I made this decision I interviewed for a PM internship which recieved, this summer I will continue working at Microsoft as a program management intern under Data Intellegence.</p>
